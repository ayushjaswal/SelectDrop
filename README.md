This is a chrome extension that enables the user to automatically change the highlight color of chrome to a more lighter and aesthetic color. The current text highlight color of chrome is very contrasty for windows.
However for mac it is perfect. So taking inspiration from there I've build this small extention that get's the job done.

To be able to use this extension
  1. Download or clone this repository to your local machine.
  2. Open chrome, and go to extensions. 
  3. Turn on developer mode and click on load extention pack
  4. select the folder where you have saved this file
  5. Done!

This is just version 1.0 for this mini useful project. I am also planning on giving the user, the freedom to select whatever text highlight color they want. But that is for next update. 

It is not available on chrome web store because I ain't spending $5 for this thing.

PS: If you want to make some changes or have a good plan for this, then you are free to fork this repo and create a pull request. Or fill in the issue forum.

Bye have a nice day!â˜•
